"""Dynamic symbol map for Indian equities.

This module builds a mapping of every equity symbol available on the
Indian stock exchanges (NSE and BSE) across a number of supported
brokers.  The data is generated from publicly available instrument dumps
so that the map automatically stays up to date without having to maintain
it manually.

Only the common exchange token is used for most brokers as they rely on
the standard exchange instrumentation.  Dhan uses its own security id,
which is retrieved from their master scrip file and joined with the
exchange token information.
